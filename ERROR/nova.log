... u"RescheduledException: Build of instance xxx-yyy-zzz was re-scheduled: internal error: no supported architecture for os type 'hvm'\n"]
... NoValidHost: No valid host was found. There are not enough hosts available.


SOLUTION

This due to running OpenStack within a virtual machine. As on the compute host you are trying to run KVM but the virtualisation extensions KVM require are not available [1].

To resolve the issue edit your /etc/nova/nova.conf to use qemu.

libvirt_type=qemu
